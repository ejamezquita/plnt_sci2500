    "- Review the arithmetic operators in Python\n",
    "- Utilize loops to perform repeated operations and to store, access, and manipulate data in one more or lists\n",
    "- Use conditional statements to control code flow.\n",
    "- Write your own functions with a defined input and output\n",

    "### Practice Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the internet as a resource for learning how to write code, learn new things, and troubleshoot problems\n",
    "- Solve a variety of problems using code\n",
    "- Troubleshoot errors and debug your code as issues arise (you'll do this all the time in this course!)\n",
    "- Practice open science by checking others' results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will practice some fundamental progamming techniques and skills using the Python programming language *while* also learning about plant phyllotaxis.

Make sure to use Slack and office hours if you run into issues!\n",
