    "\n",
    "We will keep exploring the dataset on cannabinoids concentration in hemp-fed cattle. In the last in-class asignment, we showed that indeed some &Delta;9-THC (the main psychoactive component of cannabis) concentrated in the adipose tissue of these cattle. This THC *could* then go into the body of whomever eats the cattle, and the final consumer *could* suffer from unintended THC exposure.\n",

    "\n",
    "According to the [European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)](https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2015.4141), the allowable daily exposure rates are:\n",
    "+ 1 &micro;g/kg for &Delta;9-THC\n",
    "+ 150 &micro;g/kg for CBD\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the rate depends on the subject body mass (in kg). People will be exposed to THC by consuming fat.\n",
