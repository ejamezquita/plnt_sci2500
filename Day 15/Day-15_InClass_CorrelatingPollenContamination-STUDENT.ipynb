    "\n",
    "As willows move higher with climate change, they will drive postpollination interference, reducing the fitness benefits of pollinator visitation for *Polemonium viscosum* (alpine skypilot) and selecting for traits that reduce pollinator sharing. The authors probed potential impacts of interference from encroaching *Salix* (willows) on pollination quality of *Polemonium*. Overlap in flowering time of *Salix* and *Polemonium* is a precondition for interference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pollinator sharing was ascertained from observations of willow pollen on bumble bees visiting *Polemonium* flowers and on *Polemonium* pistils. The authors measured the **correlation between *Salix* pollen contamination and seed set in naturally pollinated *Polemonium***. \n",
    "After accounting for variance in flowering date due to latitude, *Salix* and *Polemonium* showed similar advances in flowering under warmer summers. This trend supports the idea that **sensitivity to temperature promotes reproductive synchrony in both species**. \n",
