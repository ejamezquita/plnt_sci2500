    "# Part 1: Finding Data Online\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far in the course, we've often provided you with datasets for our previous assignments to work with. However, there is a vast treasure trove of data on the internet, and we want to ensure that you can find and access these resources online. This assignment builds on your understanding of how to load in data you find on the internet as well as how the context of your data informs the claims you can make! Aside from being an important skill to develop in general, this will also prove invaluable for most of you when working on your semester projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all datasets are created equal. There are several important qualities that you should look for as you pick a dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use data that comes from reliable sources.** There should be a citation you can give for any data you end up using. Sometimes, some of the most reliable sources come from government agencies--CDC, FDA, the CIA (strangely), etc.--as well as large NGOs/non-profit organizations (E.g., World Bank). This isn't necessarily a hard and fast rule for our purposes here, but it works well as a general rule of thumb.\n",
    "2. **Consider Context.** Not only should your data be from a reliable source, but you should also ensure that you can find sufficient context for your dataset to know how the context will inform any claims you make from the data.\n",
    "1. **The data should be rich.** The power that computers have brought to modern data analysis is that they allow us to look at many variables in massive data sets. You should look for data that contains multiple variables (4+) and has many values for each variable (greater than 1000). \n",
    "1. **...But not too rich (just for this assignment).** We don't want you spending too much time trimming down data for this assignment (not true for your semester project!). We recommend looking for datasets that are  less than 5 MB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of potential resources we recommend for finding data. You don't need to use any of these, but they can be helpful if you're unsure of where to start. Also, this list is by no means an exhaustive list and you should feel free to search around for other good data sources as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Food and Agricultural Organization:](https://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data) Data mostly related to economics.\n",
    "* [Kaggle:](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) Kind of a random assortment of data sets. We’ve found everything from data on roadkill in Vermont to an exhaustive compilation of memes.\n",
    "* [UNICEF:](https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/) Health-related data.\n",
    "* [World Health Organization:](https://www.who.int/data/collections) More Health-related data.\n",
    "* [World Bank:](https://data.worldbank.org/) Economic Data\n",
    "* [Dryad:](https://datadryad.org/) Repository of raw data for published peer-reviewed papers\n",
    "\n",
    "And, [this article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/free-datasets-for-projects/) does a nice job of summarizes a large number of places were you can find datasets that make for good data analysis projects.\n",

    "# Part 2: Using New Coding Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical skill for you to develop is the ability to find and use new coding tools from online sources. Thus far, we’ve often provided you with the tools that you need for class, mainly coming from Numpy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. However, there are many (*many*) more tools available to the python coder that we haven’t talked about. If you want to learn these tools on your own, it’s best to use a coding skill that we'll refer to as **tinkering.** \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Ideas for Tinkering with Code\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always have a copy of the original code, in case you break things too much and need to start over.** You can use the copy/comment/paste method (not officially recognized as a thing; just what we’re calling it). \n",
    "1. **Make sure there is some output to see the effect of the changes you make.** Either plot the results or print them, with a preference for plotting (easier to see changes!) \n",
    "1. **Look for specific values in the code that you can change.** Change the value of any numbers/strings you see. \n",
    "1. **Test your understanding of the code.** When you feel like you understand how things work, make some predictions about what will happen if you change specific values.\n",
    "1. **Use your understanding of the code to get it to work for your purposes.** Ultimately, we tinker with code to figure out how to use new tools that we find online. \n",
