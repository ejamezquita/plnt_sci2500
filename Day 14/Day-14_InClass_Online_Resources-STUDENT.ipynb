    "**Example** Below are two example plots, which have been created using the data retrived in the example in the pre-class assignment (i.e., Cocoa Export data taken from the FAO). When presenting plots of this dataset, it might make sense to use the linear plot to note how much of the total exports are coming from just a small handful of countries--most of which are on Africa's west coast--and put special empahsis on the dominant role played by the Cote d'Ivoire. As a second plot, it would be reasonable use the log plot to talk about how there are still many countries that have *some* Cocoa bean exports, just significantly less than the top few countries. \n",
