    "* Take in a string variable\n",
    "* Check if the string actually consists of separate items\n",
    "* Return a list with the separated items\n",
    "* Otherwise, return a list containing a single variable, namely the input string\n",
    "* __Important__: The function should always return a list\n",
    "* *Hint 1*: The only three separators you should check for are `'/'`, `', '`, and `' and '`. Pay attention to the blank spaces\n",
    "* *Hint 2*: A string variable can be split by a specific character/characters using the `.split()` function\n",
    "\n",

    "print(variable.split('&'))\n",

    "#### Function 2: Getting a list of *unique* values\n",

    "Your function should do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take in a list of string values (use the test data as an example)\n",
    "* Create a list that can be used to keep track of the unique values. This will be your bag of unique values.\n",
    "* Loop over the list of all strings\n",
    "* For each of these strings, get another list with the split values. Use Function 1 to do this.\n",
    "* Now loop through this new list (a nested loop)\n",

    "* Add unique values to your list as you find them\n",
