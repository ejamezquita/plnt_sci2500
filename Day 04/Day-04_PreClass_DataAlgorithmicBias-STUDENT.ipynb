For example in plant science, when analyzing ~300,000 published papers between 2000 and 2020, we can find striking geographical biases that are correlated with national affluence. Gender imbalances were also evident, with far more papers led by authors with masculine names than those by authors with feminine names. Last, there are substantial taxonomic sampling gaps. The vast majority of surveyed studies focused on major crop and model species, and the remaining biodiversity accounted for only a fraction of publications [(Marks *et al* 2023)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2217564120). \n",
