    "\n",
    "Soybean is currently promoted in sub-Saharan Africa as a high-quality protein source. Breeding soybean for improved seed composition requires understanding how cultivars interact with these new environments. This study evaluated genotype by environment interactions and the genetic diversity of cultivars grown in the Pan-African Soybean Variety Trials (PATs). They identified cultivars with increased protein or oil in specific environments or stable performance across environments. Their results provide valuable resources for improving soybean seed composition in sub-Saharan Africa. Work supported by USAID's Feed the Future Soybean Innovation Lab and by the University of Missouri Northern Soybean Breeding Program. \n",
