    "\n",
    "In many applications, data depends on other data. This is expressed with dependent variables that depend on independent variables. For example, in the past in-class we saw that there is a correlation between the number of days needed for willow (*Salix*) to flower and summer temperature. This means that there is a mystery function $f$ that by knowing temperature, we can **predict** the flowering day:\n",
    "$$f\\:(\\text{Min. June Temperature}) = \\text{Willow flowering days}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the problems that arises in data science is that the data is invariably imperfect. We often say that the data has \"noise\" or \"fluctuations\". The problem is that we know that some of these fluctuations are not real: they are caused by errors in our measurements or any other factor that is not in our control. We do not want to take those fluctuations literally. In other cases the fluctuations might actually be real, but we don't want to focus our attention on those details because we simply want the trend. Regression solves this problem by providing a methodology to find a smoother function that is consistent with your data but doesn't attempt to match every detail, which may or may not be a real signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common form of regression is called **simple linear regression**. Simple linear regression finds the best line that goes through noisy data. For example, looking *both* at scatterplot and at the Pearson correlation coefficient, we know that it makes sense to fit a line between temperature and willow flowering day.\n",
