    "## 1. Making decisions in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes when we're writing a program, we run into a situation where the right next step is contigent on whether or not a particular condition is true or not. If it *is* true, we might want to do one thing, but if it *is not* true, we might want to do something else entirely. This is sometimes referred to as \"branching\". Basically, conditional statements, where something is evaluated to be `True` or `False`, allow Python to make decisions about how to move forward. When it comes to making decisions in Python, there are two ideas that you need to understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main command in Python is the `if` statement; or, more generally, the `if-then-else` construct\n",
    "2. Boolean logic (the conditional True/False statement) allows you to perform tests that return `True` or `False`, which you then use to move foward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Taken together, these two features of a programming language are essential for getting our codes to carry out complex tasks. These statments generally play a key role in data science as we often need the computer to sift through large data sets depending on what we wish to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should also pause for a moment to reflect on that fact that you're already been exposed to Boolean logic statement when you've written `while` loops. Basically, the `while` loops tells Python to keep doing the same thing until the conditional statement becomes `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now**, to learn more about boolean logic and if statements, watch the video below."

For example, if you type `a = 1` in one Jupyter notebook and then `print(a)` in another notebook, the print statement will throw an error.\n",

Any variables that the function will use should be defined as input arguments, and any variables you want to access after running the function must be returned (and saved in your notebook as a new variable!). \n",
