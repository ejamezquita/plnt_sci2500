    "    * LLMs rely on a type of AI called deep neural networks, specifically transformers.\n",
    "    * Transformers help the model understand relationships between words in a sentence, even if they’re far apart.\n",
    "1. **They Represent Words as Numbers**\n",

    "    * This allows the model to do math on language and capture meaning in a way computers understand.\n",
    "1. **They Get Better Through Training**\n",
    "    * During training, the model adjusts millions (or billions) of internal parameters to reduce prediction errors.\n",

    "1. **Embeddings = Words as Coordinates**\n",
