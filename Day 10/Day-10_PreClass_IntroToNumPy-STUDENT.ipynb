    "* If you still have any questions about how they work, or how to better use them, post your thoughts on our Slack channel. \n",
    "* It is really important to keep in mind that Jupyter notebooks are based on cells. This is a markdown cell, for example. Because you can execute the cells in any order you wish, *it is up to you to keep track of what has been done, or not*. If it helps, you can make an initial habit of running all cells from the top down, although there will be cases where you won't want to do that. \n",
    "* It is worth taking a few minutes to get better at keyboard shortcuts, which will make using the notebooks much more efficient; and, learning some markdown is also helpful. Both are in this [webpage](https://murillogroupmsu.com/introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks/), and you can also do a web search to find other tutorials on these topics. \n",
    "* One of the best things about the notebooks is **rapid prototyping of code**. This means: try something quickly, delete it and move on. With the keyboard shortcuts, this becomes quite fast. Suppose you want to know what `4 + 5 * 3` will give. The steps are simple:\n",
    "    * press `Esc` to get out of the cell you are in (go into command mode)\n",
    "    * press `B` to create a cell below (or `A` for above - your choice)\n",
    "    * press `Return`/`Enter` to enter/activate the cell (to go into edit mode)\n",
    "    * type in your test (e.g., `4 + 5 * 3`)\n",
    "    * press `shift` + `Enter`\n",
    "    * press `Esc` to get out of the interior of the cell (go from edit to command mode)\n",
    "    * press `X` (or `D` twice) to delete that temporary cell\n",
    "* Sometimes, when trying to debug your code, it can be really useful to be able to see the line numbers (usually Python will tell you in which line it found an error). To do this:\n",
    "    * press `Esc` to get out of the cell you are in (to go into command mode)\n",
    "    * press `Shift` + `L` to turn on lines numbers\n",
    "    \n",
    "This may seem like a lot of steps, but once you memorize the shortcuts, you can rapidly create, use and delete cells. And using line numbers is a good way to better review your code and discuss it with someone else. When you have an error, this is best way to quickly isolate parts of the code to test them.\n",

NumPy allows you to do mathematical operations both more easily (from a coding perspective) and faster (in the sense of how long you need to wait for the result). \n",
