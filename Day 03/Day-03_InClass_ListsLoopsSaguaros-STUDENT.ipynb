    "\n",
    "Today we will use data on seventy-five years of mortality and regeneration research in the saguaro cactus population at Saguaro National Park. Notably, mortality rates are age-dependent, with older saguaros showing higher death rates, particularly after environmental stressors like the 2011 freeze. The research emphasizes the importance of long-term monitoring to understand the effects of human and environmental factors on this long-lived species. Importantly, cacti are analyzed based on their height class or height type:\n",
