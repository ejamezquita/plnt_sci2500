    "\n",
    "Sustainable agricultural management practices aimed at improving soil health can alter the soil microbiome, which can influence plant health and defenses against insects. The western corn rootworm (WCR), *Diabrotica virgifera virgifera* LeConte, is a major belowground pest of corn. Pest management relies heavily on the planting of transgenic crops expressing *Bacillus thuringiensis* (Bt) toxins. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this dataset, authors ask how corn-WCR interactions via the soil microbiome are affected by field management style when combined with transgenic Bt corn.\n",
    "- **Conservational management**: Extended corn-soybean-wheat rotation with cover crops under no-till.\n",
    "- **Conventional (traditional) management**: Corn-soybean rotation under mulch tillage and no cover crops.\n",
