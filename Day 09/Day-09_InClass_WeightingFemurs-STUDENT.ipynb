    "    - Allometric relationships explain why large animals don’t look like scaled-up versions of small animals.\n",
    "    - E.g. Elephants have thicker legs relative to their body size than mice because their weight increases faster than their strength if proportions stayed the same.\n",
    "- **Metabolic Scaling**\n",
    "    - Metabolic rate doesn’t increase linearly with body size. Larger animals use energy more efficiently per unit of body mass.\n",
    "    - E.g. a mouse eats much more food relative to its size than an elephant.\n",
    "- **Ecological Interactions**\n",
    "    - Allometry affects feeding strategies, movement, and predator-prey dynamics.\n",
    "    - E.g.: The size of jaws relative to body size determines what an animal can eat.\n",
    "- **Evolutionary Constraints**\n",
    "    - Growth patterns influence how species evolve. Certain body shapes or limb proportions are favored because they optimize survival and reproduction.\n",
    "- **Practical Applications**\n",
    "    - Used in fisheries to estimate fish weight from length.\n",
    "    - Important in plant ecology for understanding how tree height relates to trunk diameter and resource allocation.\n",

    "- If $b < 1$, we say the (allometric) relationship is *sub-linear*: the weight increases much slower than the femur size\n",
    "- If $b = 1$, we say the relationship is *linear*: the weight increases at the same rate as the femur size\n",
    "- If $b > 1$, we say the relationship is *super-linear*: the weight increases much faster than the femur size\n"
