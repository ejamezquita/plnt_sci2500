PLNT_SCI 2500 is being taught using what is known as the \"flipped classroom\" model. This may or may not be familiar to you, so watch the following video on what a flipped classroom is to help you get up to speed.\n",

    "In short, a flipped classroom has students spending time outside of class working through instructional materials developed by the professor known as pre-class assignments. In the context of this course, this will entail things such as watching video lectures made by the instructional staff or found online, reading articles, and working through structured coding activities. One benefit to doing this is it allows students to learn from these materials at their own pace. During a lecture, students must work at the pace of whoever is giving the lecture. But here, one can rewind videos as needed, reread passages, or move past material they feel they have already mastered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the work being done at home is so that the time in class can be spent working on what would have traditionally been labeled as “homework assignments” with other students in this class. We will be referring to these as \"in-class assignments.\" During these in-class assignments, the instructional staff are there to provide focused support where needed and help to alleviate any confusion surrounding the material. This model of instruction allows for students to get more one-on-one attention from teachers as well as additional support that comes from working with other people. \n",
    "\n",
    "The classroom is “flipped” in the sense that what would have traditionally been done in class (e.g. lecturing) is now being done at home (pre-class assignments), and the aspects that would normally be done at home (in-class assignments) is being worked on during class where the instructional staff can provide needed support.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale for adopting this model in the specific context of our course is so that time outside of class can be spent learning about the underlying concepts of computational modeling and data analysis, and in-class time can be spent ***doing*** computational modeling and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to learning might be quite different than what you are used to, especially if most of your prior classes have used traditional lecture formats. However, although this classroom experience is different, the end result will still be the same -- you **will** learn the content! In fact, research has shown that there are many benefits to learning in a flipped classroom and many times students learn **more** than they would in a more traditional classroom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, in order to get the most of out of the flipped classrooms model used by PLNT_SCI 2500, **you need to complete the pre-class assignments and fully engage with the in-class activities**. If you don't invest the time before coming to class, you will find that the in-class activities are much more challenging. \n",
