    "Last class we discussed the t-test as a very useful statistical test to check whether two populations have similar means or not. However, you must always remember that the t-test might fail if your data does not follow some requirements. \n",
    "- **[Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution)**: data from both populations must be *sort of* normally distributed\n",

    "### 1.1 The usual pipeline (unfortunately)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see that a common practice is to:\n",
    "1. You do [**Shapiro-Wilk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test) statistical tests to check if your populations are normally distributed. Don't worry much about the true meaning of Shapiro-Wilk, just keep in mind that it will return a p-value.\n",
    "2. You verify that all the Shapiro-Wilk **p-values** are *large* and you claim that all your populations are indeed normally distributed.\n",
    "3. You then do a [**Levene**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levene%27s_test) statistical test to check if your populations all share the save standard deviation. Don't worry much about the true meaning of Levene, just keep in mind that it will return a p-value.\n",
    "4. You verify that the Levene **p-value** is *large* and you claim homoscedasticity.\n",
    "5. Then you claim that the **t-test** conditions are met, so you can compute a bunch of t-tests and check the p-values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last class we did the last step ignoring the previous four.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the pipeline described above should be discouraged. Shapiro-Wilk or Levene are just examples. Each test in a sense is like a Jenga piece, and the more tests you do based on other tests, the higher chances are that you have an unstable tower waiting to collapse. Some normality tests only truly work when you have limited data. Others only work when you have lots of data. Others work when you have \"in-between\" data. It can get messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 DataViz as the alternative\n",
    "\n",
    "That does not mean you can ignore normality and homoscedasticity requirements. It means that you should check for these conditions *visually* rather than *just* numerically. **Statistical testing is important, but it is only meaningful if it is supported with visualizations!**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To check for normality, we will do Q-Q plots\n",
    "- To check for homoscedasticity (*lovely mouthful*), we will visually replicate Levene's test.\n",
